**Objective:** Today, we focused on applying Java OOP principles in hands-on exercises, emphasizing real-world scenarios to strengthen our practical understanding. Additionally, we reviewed our progress in a retrospective meeting, discussing both successes and challenges.

**Reflective:** enriching

**Interpretive:** Practicing Java OOP concepts reinforced their importance in structuring robust applications. The retrospective provided valuable insights into team dynamics and highlighted opportunities for improvement in our approach to problem-solving.

**Decision:** I will continue to refine my application of OOP concepts through targeted practice and actively implement the lessons learned from the retrospective to enhance my coding practices and teamwork.
